# Game Results Tracking Platform - Requirements Index

This file now serves as an index to the phase-specific requirement docs. Each phase contains its own context, scope, API/UI plans, and status.

- R1 — User Management: see `requirements/R1-user-management.md`
- R2 — Game Management: see `requirements/R2-game-management.md`
- R3 — Result Tracking: see `requirements/R3-result-tracking.md`
- R4 — Scoreboards: see `requirements/R4-scoreboards.md`
- R5 — System Integration & Testing: see `requirements/R5-integration-testing.md`

All finalized technical decisions apply across phases:
- Data Storage: SQLite
- Image Upload: Local file system
- Sessions: Cookie-based
- UI: Tailwind components

MVP timeline remains week-based across R1→R4, with R5 as ongoing polish.

# Game Results Tracking Platform - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation plan for building a game results tracking platform with user management, game creation, result tracking, and scoreboards.

## Phase 1: User Management (R1) - CURRENT
### Completed
- ‚úÖ Modified users API for username-only accounts (R1.1)

### In Progress
- üîÑ Add user update endpoint for username modification (R1.2)
- üîÑ Create user management UI components
- üîÑ Add client-side user creation form

### Pending
- ‚è≥ Add user authentication state management
- ‚è≥ Create user profile page
- ‚è≥ Add username validation on frontend

## Phase 2: Game Management (R2)
### API Layer
- Create `/api/games` endpoint for CRUD operations
- Add image upload endpoint `/api/games/upload`
- Implement game search functionality

### Data Model
```typescript
interface Game {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  type: 'video' | 'table' | 'card';
  imageUrl: string;
  createdBy: number; // user id
  createdAt: string;
}
```

### UI Components
- Game creation form with image upload
- Game browser/search interface
- Game card component

## Phase 3: Result Tracking (R3)
### API Layer
- Create `/api/results` endpoint
- Add game history endpoint `/api/users/{id}/history`

### Data Model
```typescript
interface GameResult {
  id: number;
  gameId: number;
  players: {
    userId: number;
    username: string;
    score: number;
    won: boolean;
  }[];
  timestamp: string;
  notes?: string;
}
```

### UI Components
- Result submission form
- Game history view
- Player score input component

## Phase 4: Scoreboards (R4)
### API Layer
- Create `/api/games/{id}/scoreboard` endpoint
- Add overall rankings endpoint `/api/scoreboards`

### Features
- Win/loss ratio calculations
- Player rankings per game
- Overall standings across all games
- Auto-updating rankings

### UI Components
- Scoreboard display component
- Player ranking cards
- Statistics dashboard

## Phase 5: System Integration (R5)
### File Upload
- Configure Next.js for image uploads
- Add file validation and storage
- Implement image optimization

### Data Persistence
- Set up local storage or simple file-based persistence
- Consider future database migration path

### Testing
- Add API route tests
- Component testing for key features
- Integration tests for user flows

## Technical Decisions - FINALIZED

### Data Storage: SQLite ‚úÖ
- Local database with easy migration path
- Persistent data between sessions
- SQL queries for complex scoreboards

### Image Upload: Local File System ‚úÖ
- Store images in `/public/uploads/` directory
- Simple file management
- No external dependencies

### User Session Management: Cookies ‚úÖ
- Session-based with HTTP cookies
- Secure and standard approach
- Easy future auth integration

### UI Framework: Custom Tailwind Components ‚úÖ
- Continue with Tailwind CSS utilities
- Build custom reusable components
- Keep dependencies minimal

## MVP Delivery Timeline
1. **Week 1:** Complete R1 (User Management)
2. **Week 2:** Implement R2 (Game Management) 
3. **Week 3:** Build R3 (Result Tracking)
4. **Week 4:** Create R4 (Scoreboards) + Polish

## Risk Mitigation
- Keep data models simple and extensible
- Focus on core functionality over UI polish
- Implement proper error handling from start
- Plan for easy database migration later

## Scope Decisions - FINALIZED

1. **Scope:** Smaller MVP focusing on core functionality ‚úÖ
2. **Multiplayer:** 1v1 games only for MVP ‚úÖ
3. **Games:** Users cannot edit/delete created games ‚úÖ
4. **Results:** Users cannot edit/delete submitted results ‚úÖ

## Refined MVP Requirements
- User account creation (username only)
- Create games with image upload
- Submit 1v1 game results 
- View basic scoreboards
- Browse existing games

## Still To Decide
- Username validation rules
- Scoring systems per game type
- Privacy settings for viewing results

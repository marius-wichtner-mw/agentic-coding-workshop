## R5: System Integration & Testing

### Context
Polish, production-readiness tasks, and cross-cutting concerns.

### Goals
- File uploads: configure Next.js, validate files, optimize images.
- Data persistence: confirm SQLite path and plan migrations.
- Testing: expand API and component tests, add integration/e2e for key flows.

### Status
- Ongoing. Baseline unit tests added; coverage currently 100% across existing modules.
